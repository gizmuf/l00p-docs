## Teaching Ghost

The more you talk to Ghost, the better it understands you.

### Ways to teach Ghost:

1. **Answer questions honestly** - Don't tell Ghost what you think sounds good, tell it the truth

2. **Correct Ghost when wrong** - If Ghost suggests something that doesn't fit you, say so:
   ```
   You: "Actually, I don't like hiking that much anymore"
   Ghost: "Got it! I'll update your themes. What do you enjoy now?"
   ```

3. **Share more context** - The more detail you provide, the better:
   ```
   Instead of: "I like music"
   Try: "I'm really into jazz and go to live shows most weekends"
   ```

4. **Ask for suggestions** - Ghost learns from your feedback:
   ```
   You: "Who do you think I'd vibe with?"
   Ghost: [Suggests matches]
   You: "Not really feeling Maya, but Zara looks interesting"
   Ghost: [Learns your type better]
   ```

## Ghost Actions

When Ghost learns something important, it may suggest profile updates:

       🎵 Music • ☕ Coffee • 🌃 Night Owl
       Should I add these to your profile?"
[Add all] [Let me choose] [Not now]
